## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security-related issues or vulnerabilities, please privately
report them to our team by emailing
[security@telenor.no](mailto:security@telenor.no). Please refrain from creating
Issues and other forms of publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities until we have
had a chance to address them.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy. Our security team will
work with you to investigate and address any reported vulnerabilities. We kindly
request that you adhere to the following guidelines:

- Share the details of the vulnerability with our security team in a responsible
  and confidential manner.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any public
  disclosure.
- Do not exploit any vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the
  vulnerability.
